# Sparse-Imaging-for-Spinning-Space-Targets-with-Short-Time-Observation

The results of the paper "Sparse Imaging for Spinning Space Targets with Short Time Observation" can be obtained by running "main.m" in Matlab 2019a.

The ".m" files are code in Matlab, and the ".mat" files are the experiment data.

main.m: main program.

azimuth_processing.m: proposed imaging method for the block-missed HRRPs.

PskLiang.m: use the Gold code to generate the orthogonal signal.

MSL0RE.m: smooth L0-norm algorithm.

soft.m: soft threshold function.
image_entropy.m: calculate the image entropy by 256 quantification.

entropy2cl.m: variation of the image entropy with the code length.

swqLFM.mat: experiment data by transmitting LFM signal.

swqGoldZ.mat: experiment data by transmitting the orthogonal Gold coding signal.
